# Angular Project Starter

A simple Angular project starter. It has all of the typical Angular CLI generated files with the addition of a CoreModule, SharedModule, and LoggingService.
It is also preconfigured with ESLint and Prettier for linting and code styling.

This starter is mostly for my personal Angular projects but if you would like to use it for your projects you are more than welcome too.
If you have any suggestions for additional modules, services, or configs that would make this a better starter repo, please reach out or open a PR.
